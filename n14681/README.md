∙ Area of quadrant

For exemple, a point with a coordinate of (12, 4) belongs to the first quadrant because both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate are positive numbers.

And a point B belongs to the second quadrant because the x-coordinate is a negative and the y-coordinate is a positive.

Write a program that takes the coordinates of a point as input and finds out which quadrant the point belongs to.

However, it is assumed that both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate are positive or negative.
